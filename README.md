# Bobo the Robo: TWIP Robot with Arduino

I set out following an Instructable by [@midhun_s2017](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Self-Balancing-Robot-1/).

I'm not going to repeat what has already been provided, so I'll just share the bits I changed.

- [updated list of parts](parts/list_of_parts.md)
- [circuit](circuit_wiring/bobo-the-robo_circuit_diagram_drv8835.pdf) and [layout](circuit_wiring/bobo-the-robo_perfboard_drv8835.pdf)
- [complete code](sketches/complete_code/complete_code_v7/complete_code_v7.ino)


I ended up not integrating the US sensor. Our one year old daughter broke the cables and frankly I couldn't be bothered to go soldering again, after all the balancing functionality worked: [Bobo the Robo](https://youtu.be/l3WrvmigYPI).
